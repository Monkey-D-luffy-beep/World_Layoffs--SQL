Finding companies with the largest single layoffs and the most total layoffs.

SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM world_layoff.layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY SUM(total_laid_off) DESC
LIMIT 10;

2) Temporal Trends:
Analyzing layoffs over time by year and month, including a rolling total of layoffs per month.

WITH DATE_CTE AS (
    SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) AS dates, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
    FROM layoffs_staging2
    GROUP BY dates
    ORDER BY dates ASC
)
SELECT dates, SUM(total_laid_off) OVER (ORDER BY dates ASC) AS rolling_total_layoffs
FROM DATE_CTE
ORDER BY dates ASC;


3) Yearly Ranking:
Ranking companies by layoffs on a per-year basis using window functions.
WITH Company_Year AS (
    SELECT company, YEAR(`date`) AS years, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_laid_off
    FROM layoffs_staging2
    GROUP BY company, YEAR(`date`)
),
Company_Year_Rank AS (
    SELECT company, years, total_laid_off,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS ranking
    FROM Company_Year
)
SELECT company, years, total_laid_off, ranking
FROM Company_Year_Rank
WHERE ranking <= 3 AND years IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY years ASC, total_laid_off DESC;
